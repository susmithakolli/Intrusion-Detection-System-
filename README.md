# Intrusion-Detection-System

The aim of this project is to build an Intrusion detection system. A machine learning based classification algorithm is used to differentiate the malicious and secure connections. The intrusion techniques such as DOS, R2L, U2R, probing are taken as classification classes of malicious connections.
